I fully developed both the backend and frontend. The blog was managed through a custom CMS built with Laravel and Filament. Real-time patient data handling was implemented using Laravel, while the frontend was built with Vue and Tailwind CSS to ensure a secure, responsive, and user-friendly experience.
